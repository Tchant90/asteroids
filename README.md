Asteroids boot.dev project

Play Asteroids with Python!

Objective: Shoot asteroids, don't get hit by asteroids.  If you do, game over!

W / S: Move forward and backward
A / D : Rotate ship left and right
Space : Fire the gun! 

Note: Just being upfront - made with heavy assistance from AI on boot.dev.  This is my largest project to date,
and while the beginning was relatively easy to code/troubleshoot, it became much more complex the more systems
added to the game.  I learned a lot about pygame, interactions between different classes, and working between
more than 1 or 2 python files at once to create a larger, more complex program.  I have a lot more respect for
game devs after this project.  Onto the next!
